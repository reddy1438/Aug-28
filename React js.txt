App.js :

This is the file for App Component. App Component is the main component in React which acts as a container for all other components.

index.js:

This is the javascript file corresponding to index.html. This file has the following line of code which is very significant. ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById(‘root’));

App.css:

This is the CSS file corresponding to App Component.

index.html:

When the application starts this is the first page that is loaded. This will be the only html file in the entire application since React is generally Written using JSX which I will cover later. Also, this file has a line of code <div id=”root”></div>. This line is very significant since all the application components are loaded into this div.
